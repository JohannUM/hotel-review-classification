# Hotel Review Classification

### This is a NLP project for the Natural Language Processing course (KEN2570) at [Maastricht University](https://www.maastrichtuniversity.nl/)

Using the [TripAdvisor Hotel Reviews](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/tripadvisor-hotel-reviews) dataset we want to classify the hotel reviews based on the text in to a rating of 1 to 5 stars.

For this we will build and compare different NLP models for classification.

### More details on the project will be added later...
